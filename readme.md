Hi I am Sophie, your teaching fellow for EC304 in Fall 2020. I am a third-year PhD student at the economics department who does research in applied micro.

## Important things to know

EC304 discussion session runs on Friday from 10:10 - 11 am. The discussion session mainly covers your problem sets and materials which would be helpful to your problem sets. As you should have known already, problem sets are only graded on completeness, so do not sweat if you got stuck. We will sort them out sooner or later.

Under BU regulations, students rotate between in-person and online classes. Please only come to in-person classes when it is your turn (rotation groups can be found on Blackboard). Surgical masks and a green badge showing that you are up to date with your COVID testing and you do not have any symptoms are both required during an in-person class.

#### Not wearing a surgical mask or not complying with university COVID guidelines makes you ineligbile to attend in-person classes. You will not be permitted to enter the classroom. There is no penalty in attending classes remotely. You are encouraged to attend classes remotely if you just went to a large gathering, missed a scheduled testing, or having any symptoms.

## Other logistics

If you have any administrative questions (such as when is the problem set due, when will the midterm be held, how is the problem set going to graded etc), please refer to your syllabus. If you are not sure whether your question is answered in the syllabus, read the syallbus. Chances are I do not know these things on the top of my head, so I will go to the syllabus and find the answers and email them back to you and tell you to read the syllabus (for the 100th times). You can save us both a lot time by just reading the syallbus on your own.

Other questions could be sent to my email ywl242@bu.edu and I will answer them in a day or two. Most problem sets related questions should be answered in discussion sessions and office hours. I will try accommodate you if you can not attend discussion sessions or office hours because of time zone differences.
